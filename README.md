# Dumb-CS2-Configs

**Download/Installing:**

	1. Download the config as a ZIP:
		Near the top right of the page it should say "Download ZIP", click it.
		If it asks, confirm the download, and send it to the "Downloads" folder.
		(If for some reason it warns you that the download may be malicious. 
		Cancel the download and contact me at "soloischilling" on Discord. 
		That way, I can fix the issue and remove any potentially malicious code.)
		
	2. Extract the ZIP:
		After downloading the ZIP, open your "Downloads" folder and extract it.
	
	3. Open your config folder:
		For this there are two methods of going about it.
			Method 1: Open File Explorer, and navigate to the file path below. 
				"C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\game\csgo\cfg".
			Method 2: Open Steam > Go to your library > Right click "Counter-Strike 2" > Hover over "Manage" > Click "Browse local files".
				Now File Explorer should be open to the path "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive".
				From here, open these folders, in this order, "game > csgo > cfg". 
		Now you should be in your CS2 config folder.
	
	4. Install the config into your config folder:
		Drag and drop the specific config you want to use, 
		from the extracted ZIP, into your CS2 config folder.
		
	5. Executing the config:
		Again, for this there are two methods of going about it.
			Method 1: Enter "+exec 'config_name'" in your CS2 launch options, and launch CS2. (Replace 'config_name' with the name of the config file.)
				(Easy one time thing, but means it will autoexec everytime you launch CS2, 
				until you take it out of the CS2 launch options. May trigger VAC randomly.)
			Method 2: Launch CS2 and enter "exec 'config_name'" into the console. (Replace 'config_name' with the name of the config file.)
				(You will have to do this every single time you launch the game, 
				but gives you more control. May also trigger VAC randomly, less.)

**Help:** You can use the console command "?help" in CS2, for more info on the config, just make sure you have the config executed, or the command won't work.
