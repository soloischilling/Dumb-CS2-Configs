# Dumb-CS2-Configs

## Download/Installing:

### 1. Download the config as a ZIP:
Near the top right of the page it should say "Download ZIP", click it. If it asks, confirm the download, and send it to your "Downloads" folder. 

_(The file path should be_ `C:\Users\USERNAME\Downloads` _or something similar.)_

> If for some reason it warns you that the download may be malicious, cancel the download and contact me at "soloischilling" on Discord.
> That way, I can fix the issue and remove any potentially malicious code. **-Solo**
		
### 3. Extract the ZIP:
After downloading the ZIP, open your "Downloads" folder and extract it.

_(Again, the file path should be_ `C:\Users\USERNAME\Downloads` _or something similar.)_
	
### 4. Open your config folder:
For this there are two methods of going about it.

**Method 1:** Open File Explorer, and navigate to the following file path. `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\game\csgo\cfg`
	
**Method 2:** Open Steam > Go to your library > Right click "Counter-Strike 2" > Hover over "Manage" > Click "Browse local files".
Now File Explorer should be open to the path `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive`.
From here, navigate these folders, in this order, `game\csgo\cfg`.
  
Now you should be in your CS2 config folder.

### 5. Install the config into your config folder:
Drag and drop the specific config you want to use, from the extracted ZIP, into your CS2 config folder.
		
### 6. Executing the config:
Again, for this there are two methods of going about it.

**Method 1:** Enter `+exec "config_name"` in your CS2 launch options, and launch CS2. Replace "config_name" with the name of the config file.

_(Easy one time thing, but means it will autoexec everytime you launch CS2, until you take it out of the CS2 launch options. May trigger VAC randomly.)_

**Method 2:** Launch CS2 and enter `exec "config_name"` into the console. Replace "config_name" with the name of the config file.

_(You will have to do this every single time you launch the game, but gives you more control. May also trigger VAC randomly, less.)_

## Help: 
You can use the console command `?help` in CS2, for more info on the config, just make sure you have the config executed, or the command won't work.
